            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ALVIN</hi> conjectures that this Propheſie of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> as we now have it (as the reſt of the Propheſies) was but the <hi>ſummary</hi> or <hi>brief heads</hi> of certain Sermons, which at ſeveral times and upon ſeveral occaſions were preach't unto the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> collected by himſelf, and regiſtred for the uſe and benefit of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>This Sermon he conceives begins at my Text, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct time when it was preach't, neither himſelf nor any other Expoſitor do hint; That it was before the <hi>Babylonian Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> is clear from the <hi>date</hi> of the Propheſie, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, and that may content us (ſaith he) that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth here bitterly reprove the extream obſtinacy and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſecurity of the people,<note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> The relation of a <hi>ſpouſe</hi> or <hi>wife;</hi> and that is implyed in the ſin, which is called <hi>whoredom: Whoredom</hi> or <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> you know, is properly the ſin againſt the <hi>marriage-relation. Marriage</hi> is <hi>honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God wil judg.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> Adultery is the <hi>defiling</hi> of the <hi>marriage-bed;</hi> and therefore ſome do etymon <hi>Adulterium,</hi> quaſi <hi>ad alterum,</hi> the departure of the husband or wife into the bed and boſom of a ſtranger: Here, I ſay, is the conjugal relation into which God had taken <hi>Iſrael, implyed,</hi> to the <hi>aggravation</hi> of her apoſtacy; whereby her <hi>ſin</hi> came to be <hi>Whoredom</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> againſt the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> With other Nations; rejoyce not as <hi>other people:</hi> Why? Becauſe though they have the relation of <hi>creatures</hi> unto God, and of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> yet they have not the relation of a <hi>spouſe</hi> or <hi>wife: Ye only have I known of all the families of the earth,</hi> ſaith God to Iſrael:<note place="margin">Amos 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> with a <hi>conjugal knowledg;</hi> other Nations may cal God <hi>Baali,</hi> but they cannot cal him <hi>Iſhi; i.e.</hi> they may cal him my <hi>Lord</hi> and my <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> but not my <hi>Huſband</hi> and my <hi>Redeemer;</hi> they are his by <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>common providence,</hi> but not by <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>conjugal relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now here is the <hi>aggravation:</hi> Other Nations may <hi>ſin</hi> againſt God, but they cannot commit <hi>adultery</hi> againſt God; other Nations may <hi>rebell</hi> againſt the Lord, but they cannot go <hi>a whoring</hi> from him: This was <hi>Iſraels ſin</hi> and the <hi>aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And as it was the <hi>aggravation</hi> of <hi>her ſin,</hi> ſo it was the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Gods wrath</hi> too; that, as I ſay, is implyed; for if <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels ſin</hi> be the ſin of <hi>adultery,</hi> then Gods <hi>wrath</hi> muſt needs be the wrath of <hi>jealonſie;</hi> and <hi>jealouſie</hi> as it <hi>is the rage of a man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 6.34, 35</note> ſo it is the <hi>rage of a God;</hi> anger <hi>red-hot,</hi> wrath <hi>ad octo,</hi> in the higheſt degree; <hi>Therefore he wil not ſpare in the day of vengeance; he wil not regard any ranſom, neither wil he

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jealouſie is as cruel as the grave, the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a moſt vehement flame, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> This therefore you ſee is the <hi>aggravation</hi> both of her <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>danger:</hi> By all which the Prophet calls <hi>Iſrael</hi> now to ſence of ſin, and humiliation for ſin; to be <hi>affected with,</hi> and <hi>afflicted for</hi> her grievous <hi>departure</hi> from the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now the words thus opened would afford many ſerious and ſeaſonable <hi>obſervations.</hi> I ſhal reſolve all into 4 Doctrines.</p>

               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>A people thus related unto God may (poſſibly) go a whoring from him, commit adultery againſt him.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Sometimes it comes to paſs that Gods Iſrael whilſt ſhe lieth under the guilt of whoriſh departure from her God, in ſtead of being affected with, and afflicted for her whoredom; in ſtead of mourning, and judging her ſelf before the Lord, doth ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſinfully let out her heart to carnal comfort and rejoycing.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>An Iſrael, under adulterous departures from God, hath leaſt cauſe to rejoyce; and more cauſe to mourn and lament then any nation or people under heaven.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>In theſe 4 Doctrinal Obſervations you have the ſence and ſoul of this Scripture.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas other nations have but what knowledg <hi>the book of</hi> * works can dictate to them, Iſrael hath the <hi>book of the</hi> * <hi>word; He ſheweth his word unto</hi> Iacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto</hi> Iſrael.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond advantage that Iſrael hath above nations to know God, is his <hi>works,</hi> his works of ſpecial <hi>Providence.</hi>

There is more of God manifeſted in the goings forth of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom, for the preſervation of his Church, and the ruin and deſtruction of the enemys thereof, then in all the world beſides. So that in reference to this, the Pſalmiſt ſings,<note place="margin">Pſal, 31, 19.</note> 
               <hi>oh how great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee, before the ſonnes of men!</hi> what goodneſs? why his <hi>preſerving goodneſs</hi> to his Church and people,<note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> 
               <hi>thou ſhalt hide them in the ſecret of thy preſence from the pride of man, thou ſhalt keep them ſecretly in a pavilion</hi> &amp;c. Oh the ways of God in preſerving and hiding his Church from the pride and power of men, are ſecret myſterious ways, which the world cannot diſcover.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then the third and laſt <hi>Advantage is.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Spirit</hi> as an <hi>Interpreter.</hi>
               </note> Iſrael hath an <hi>Interpreter</hi> (greater then one of a thouſand) to expound both theſe books unto her, even <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> which the world knows not. <hi>We have received,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor, 2, 12.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the <hi>word</hi> expounds the <hi>works;</hi> and the works of God do interpret the word: it is a fine skil to make works and word <hi>face</hi> one another, and <hi>anſwer</hi> over one to another; but this cannot be done without an Interpreter, that is a <hi>ſecretioribus dei, Gods privy-Counceller;</hi> and that is the <hi>Spirit</hi> which the world knoweth not, and receiveth not; and therefore is both the book of the word, ſome fragments whereof the Gentiles light upon ſometimes) and the book of the works a ſealed book, which they cannot <hi>open,</hi> or not <hi>read,</hi> if they could open.</p>
            <p>Now therefore the Church and people of God, having this three-fold advantage to a more cleer and ful diſcovery of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>wil,</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> and his hatred thereof, then all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; Iſraels ſin hath hereby an aggravation upon it, of which theirs is uncapable, an aggravation of <hi>light.
